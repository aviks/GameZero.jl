## Example
The best way to learn how to use this package is by looking at code. There are some simple examples in the [example subdirectory](https://github.com/aviks/GameZero.jl/tree/master/example/BasicGame). More comprehensive examples are listed in [GZExamples](https://github.com/SquidSinker/GZExamples).

## Status
This is an early development snapshot. Watch this space for improvements.

## Acknowledgement
The design of this library is inspired by the python package [PyGameZero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io). However, the Julia implementation is completely independent.
