The schedule type stores an array of `Sheduled` objects, and a `WallTimer`
object that is used to keep time. The scheduler object keeps its own timer, and
does not reuse the timer in the game main loop, since the game timer can be
reset every frame, while the scheduler timer needs to keep absolute time.

"""
A scheduled action that is run once. The action is a zero-argument function
that is wrapped as a WeakRef object. This ensures that schedules do not
inadvertantly store references to game objects. This does however mean that
anynymous functions should not be used as scheduled actions.

The time stored in the schedule is in absolute nanoseconds since epoch
(Note the epoch for nanoseconds can be arbitrary).
User facing times should always be in seconds, or fractions of a second, and
usually specifed as interval from current time. Hence the time should be
converted before being stored in a `Sheduled` object.

A scheduled action that is repeated indefinitely. The time of next invocation is
stored as `time`, while the interval between each invocation is stored in `interval`.
Both of these are stored in units of nanoseconds.

A contingent schdule. This type of schedule checks the return value of the action.
If the action method returns `nothing`, no further action is scheduled. Otherwise,
the return value is considered to be the interval, in seconds, to the next invocation of the action.

Since action methods are written by end users, the return value of those methods are
not considered significant for ease of use. Hence ContingentScheduled is a separate
type that should not be end user visible.
